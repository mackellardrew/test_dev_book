    "# Unit Tests vs Functional Tests\n",
    "\n",
    "Then there's a procedural note here about how to think about the two types of tests mentioned so far.  Basically (as mentioned in the previous chapter), Functional tests are meant to recapitulate the gist of the user experience, testing your code \"from the outside\" and seeing what it gets when a big chunk of it is run.  Unit tests are written from the point of view of the developer, and generally (as I interpret it at this point) test smaller chunks of your code, \"from the inside\".\n",
    "\n",
    "He further specifies the general workflow you use in Test-Driven Development:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You write a functional test meant to capture how you anticipate the user to interact with your app\n",
    "2. Once the functional test fails as expected, you think about what code you'd need to get it to pass.  But before you actually write that, you write unit tests to capture how you expect that code to work, and how those lines themselves could fail.\n",
    "3. When you have a failing unit test for what you expect to get you past (part of) the functional test, you write the smallest unit of *application code* that would do something useful.\n",
    "4. Then you iterate over steps 2 and 3 as needed until your functional test can pass.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\">I'll just quote verbatim here the last text of this section which takes yet another stab at contextualizing the distinction between these two kinds of tests: \"<i>Functional tests should help you build an application with the right functionality, and guarantee you never accidentally break it.  Unit tests should help you write code that's clean and bug-free.</i>\"</div>"
