    "# Agile vs. \"Big Design Up Front\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, another interesting point about design philosophy follows immediately.  Harry says that the traditional way to tackle large engineering projects would be to try to plan everything out with paper (or at least schematic software), figuring out where everything should go before you start writing code.  TDD, on the other hand, was derived from or otherwise aligned with the [AGILE design movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development), which emphasizes incremental, iterative design, rather than figuring you can make an overarching plan from the very get-go that will prove very robust to complications encountered when coding up the details.  Basically, get your hands dirty early on, and expect the need to refactor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, the advocated answer is still not really to just dive in mindlessly, rather, it's to think in mid-sized, modular chunks.  The emphasis is on delivering a \"minimal viable product\", getting it in the field where you can collect real-world feedback about its reception.  Furthermore, this mindset is meant to counter the temptation to add on additional features and functionality that you might envision in a \"perfect\" or otherwise optimal app.  The initialism is \"**YAGNI**\", for \"you ain't gonna need it\": let the users tell you if something is lacking.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the plan to support multiple users involves having the server return customized URLs for each user, so they see different content based on the recognition of their particular credentials, and thus previously stored list items.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## REST\n",
    "\n",
    "There's another term here, the REST (Representational State Transfer) API paradigm, which sounds like its gist is that the URL returned for any part of a web app/site should reflect the \"data structure\" of the content.  In practice, Harry suggests that the trailing part of the URL for a to-do list should contain:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `lists/new` for a page that accepts POST requests to generate new lists\n",
    "* `lists/list_name` to view the contents of an existing list\n",
    "* `lists/list_name/add_item` for a page that accepts POST requests to add to a list"

    "He suggests that refactoring to support multiple users will involve creating an entirely new functional test; not sure yet if that means a new file, a new class in our existing module, or just new methods within the existing class.  ...Ok, it is quickly revealed that it's the latter option: new methods tacked on to our existing setup.  Ah, ok, but also some refactoring of existing ones; we're not just going to leave in place the soon-to-be-irrelevant methods that assumed that all visitors to the site shared one list.  So some shuffling around of code within the tests."
