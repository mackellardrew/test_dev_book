The issue was associated with my tendency to try to run notebooks from within the WSL2 env on my Windows laptop, and the difficulty invoking Firefox from within WSL2, and pointing it at the Windows installation.  So I tried using the code above, but it doesn't manage to open a new Firefox window.  As of now, it's giving \r\n",

I tried creating the same environment in a Windows-native installation and loading it in a VS Code window running that kernel, but had difficulty installing `conda` via `pip` (it requires a GNU compiler, which is difficult to do without admin permissions).  But I eventually found that Miniconda *can* be installed and the installation dir appended to the Windows path from an installer if you remove the preexisting Python installation in Windows.  From there I was able to reconstitute the environment and load on Windows; I'll hope that downstream steps invoking a browser window will function now.\r\n",

Instructions I found kept saying to run `gh auth login`, but that returned \"`Error: No such command \"auth\"`\" for me.  I found [this note](https://github.com/cli/cli/issues/1742#issuecomment-694372134) saying that `gh` needed updating.
